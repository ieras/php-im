# PHP 原生websocket实现聊天室功能

#### Description
PHP's pure native (single file) websocket implements chat room functionality, and its load capacity has not been tested. It is only for learning reference and entertainment purposes. Of course, if your load is not high, it is not a problem for commercial use. For example, this code is mainly used to support the built-in websocket service of iHttp (Cute Cat WeChat Robot Plugin). Low loads like this are not a problem, and using a single file is mainly to make its entry cost low and deployment cost low. Those who like it can start and fork, and those who want to participate in improvement can provide PR
